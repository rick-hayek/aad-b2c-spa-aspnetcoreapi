# Set up this single page application from scratch

## Prerequisites

You should have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

## Construct the folder hierarchy

Launch a terminal, and go to your working directory. Then issue following commands:

```bash
mkdir web
cd web
mkdir -p src
npm init -y
```

## Setting up webpack

Why [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts)? Here's a [great artical](https://blog.andrewray.me/webpack-when-to-use-and-why/) talking about the ability that webpack has.

```bash
npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

Open up the [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json), which is generated by `npm init`, and add `"build": "webpack"` to `"scripts"` section:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack"
  },
```

Now from terminal (in \web\\), run command:

```bash
npm run build
```

You will get errors that complain **"Entry module not found"**. The error should be something like:

```console
ERROR in Entry module not found: Error: Can't resolve './src' in 'C:\src\rickrepo\aad-b2c-spa-aspnetcoreapi\web'
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! errno 2
npm ERR! web@1.0.0 build: `webpack`
npm ERR! Exit status 2
npm ERR!
npm ERR! Failed at the web@1.0.0 build script.
npm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above.
```

The error occurs because webpack is trying to find the entry point that is specified in configure file. Since we havn't create any configuration file, the default one will be "./src/index.js".

```text
Since version 4.0.0, webpack does not require a configuration file to bundle your project.
```

So let add the index.js to ./src/:

```bash
cd src
touch index.js
```

And add the following contents to index.js:

```JavaScript
console.log("hello webpack!");
```
