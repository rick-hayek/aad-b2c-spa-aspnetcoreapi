# setup this single page application from scratch

## Prerequisites

You should have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

## Construct the folder hierarchy

Launch a terminal, and go to your working directory. Then issue following commands:

```bash
mkdir web
cd web
mkdir -p src
npm init -y
```

## Setting up webpack

```bash
npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

Open up the [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json), which is generated by `npm init`, and add `"build": "webpack"` to `"scripts"` section:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack"
  },
```

Now from terminal (in \web\\), run command:

```bash
npm run build
```

You will get errors that complain **"Entry module not found"**. The error should be something like:

```console
ERROR in Entry module not found: Error: Can't resolve './src' in 'C:\src\rickrepo\aad-b2c-spa-aspnetcoreapi\web'
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! errno 2
npm ERR! web@1.0.0 build: `webpack`
npm ERR! Exit status 2
npm ERR!
npm ERR! Failed at the web@1.0.0 build script.
npm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above.
```
